# Rel-HNN: Split Parallel Hypergraph Neural Network for Learning on Relational Databases

Rel-HNN is a novel framework designed to learn from relational databases by transforming them into hypergraphs and leveraging a split-parallel training paradigm to scale hypergraph neural networks (HNNs) efficiently. The approach preserves both intra- and inter-tuple relationships and supports training over large-scale, multi-relational tabular data.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## üìú Preprocessing Scripts

- `preprocess_one.py`: Preprocess with one-hot encoding-based features
- `preprocess_av.py`: Preprocess with attribute-value features
- `preprocess_reg_one.py`: Preprocess regression datasets with one-hot encoding
- `preprocess_reg_av.py`: Preprocess regression datasets with attribute-value features
- `preprocess_sparse_one.py`: Preprocess with one-hot encoding-based features for sparse hypergraphs
- `preprocess_sparse_av.py`: Preprocess with attribute-value features for sparse hypergraphs

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Example Usage

To preprocess a dataset (e.g., **Cora**) using `preprocess_one.py`, run:

```bash
python3 preprocess_one.py --dataset Cora --target_file paper --target_column label
```
### ‚öôÔ∏è Argument Descriptions

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| --dataset | **(Required)** Name of the dataset directory. This folder should contain all CSV files (or similar formats) that represent tables in your relational database. For example, `Cora`. |
| --target_file | **(Required)** Name of the file (without `.csv` extension) that contains the column to be predicted. For instance, `paper` means `paper.csv` is the target table with labels. |
| --target_column | **(Required)** Name of the target column in the `target_file`. This is the column your model will be trained to predict, e.g., `label`. |
